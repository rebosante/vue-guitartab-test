    "tab": "El mágico colectivo londinense Jungle lanzó el videoclip de 'Casio', canción que hace parte de su más reciente álbum: 'Forever' (2018). La producción del clip estuvo a cargo de JFC Worldwide Production y su director, Josh Lloyd -Watson, uno de los dos líderes de la banda junto a Charlie Di Placido. En este nuevo corte audiovisual el baile, la época setentera, la atmósfera del funk y el disco son los protagonistas, regalándonos otra gran coreografía que todos se querrán aprender. \n  \n Y es que al hablar de Jungle no se pueden dejar a un lado sus videos que nos recuerdan lo importante, atractivo, vital, enérgcio y emocional que es el baile. \n  \n A diferencia de los clips de su álbum debut 'Jungle' (2014),  algunos de sus bailarines si repiten (contándonos una posible historia). Por otro lado, distintos objetos y mensajes nos dejan guiños de un posible enlace entre sus producciones audiovisuales; el cierre de 'Casio' es un -Julia, Call Me-, recordando a Julia, el track número 6 de su primer álbum que también tiene un videoclip que impresiona con el poder de sus bailarines. \n  \n Por el momento (y mientras conocemos si hay trama relacionada) vean el estreno audiovisual de Casio, y sigan bailando con House in LA, Cherry, Happy Man y Heavy California, nuevas canciones de Jungle, parte de nuestra programación.",

    "tab": "\"New Life\" is the second UK single by Depeche Mode recorded at Blackwing Studios, originally released on 29 May 1981. It was not commercially released in the United States.\n\nThere were two versions of the song available. The 7\" version would later become the \"album version\", as it would eventually appear on the UK version of Speak & Spell, released in October 1981, and a 12\" \"remix\", which differs from the album version, in that it has a different intro, intensely percussive and harder, and an added synth part in the \"solo\" vocal section in the middle of the song, which is not present on the 7\" mix. The \"remix\" would later appear on the US version of Speak & Spell.\n\nThe single became Depeche Mode's breakthrough hit in the UK, peaking at #11. On 25 June 1981, the band performed \"New Life\" during their debut on the BBC's Top of the Pops. The band would perform the song twice more on the show, on 16 July and 30 July 1981.\n\nThe B-side, \"Shout!\", is the first Depeche Mode song to get a 12\" extended remix, called the \"Rio Mix\". This mix would later appear on the remix compilation Remixes 81–04, released in 2004. It is the earliest recorded song available on the compilation."

    "tab": "Mac Miller finally got happy again on last year’s GO:OD AM. It wasn’t the naïve, punkish joy of his nascent mixtapes, though. The album presented a man thankful to be alive, who had rectified his mistakes and was showing his gratitude by letting all of his creativity flow. Having found his footing, Mac continues to peddle vibrancy on “Dang!” It’s a buoyant and bubbly song that features horns by Juilliard students (not to mention the unstoppable Anderson .Paak.\n\nOn top of an addictive funk instrumental, Mac explores the difficult terrain of misunderstandings and confusion. He’s smitten yet losing his love’s interest. He may get frustrated but he does not blame her. Instead, he asks why. What can he do to keep her from leaving? Even the song’s title is a quiet admission that something has changed for the worse, but it’s not so insurmountable as to elicit a more negative reaction. It takes true humility to simply ask when you’re hurt. Mac Miller does that on a song that can light up a dance floor and brighten your day."
